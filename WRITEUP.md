### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- VMs allows for more control and full access.
- VMs can be more modular and less dependant on Azure.
- The cost of VMs is higher.

- Web apps lacks control on what's installed and has less customizability.
- Web apps are easier to deploy.
- Web apps are cheaper in cost.

- Based on the facts above, I went with the Web application since I am a beginner at deploying Azure applications and the ease and cheaper cost of the Web apps convinced me to follow this approach.
  
### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.* 

-If I needed to deploy an application that needed to be compatible outside of Azure, a VM would need to be utilized. Also, if the cost of the VMs went down, then this would quickly turn into a better approach to ensure that the application you are trying to launch has more flexibility when it comes to its set up and also where it can be used.
